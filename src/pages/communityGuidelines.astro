      1. Safety and Civility
    </div>
    <div class="my-2 text-[16px] font-normal font-['NeueHaas'] leading-6">
      At the heart of our community lie physical and psychological safety, while
      civility forms the cornerstone for a thriving environment. Being civil
      doesn't necessitate universal agreement; rather, it's about acknowledging
      everyone's inherent dignity and engaging respectfully in actions, words,
      and tone.

    <div class="my-2 text-[16px] font-normal font-['NeueHaas'] leading-6">
      Our commitment is to foster connections without seeding physical conflict.
      We understand that online content related to violence can lead to
      real-world harm. Thus, we prohibit any form of violent threats, incitement
      to violence, or promotion of criminal activities that might endanger
      people, animals, or property. In instances of specific, credible, and
      imminent threats to human life or severe physical injury, we report to
      relevant law enforcement authorities.

    <div class="my-2 text-[16px] font-normal font-['NeueHaas'] leading-6">
      Our community thrives on diverse backgrounds, and these differences
      deserve respect rather than division. We strictly prohibit any form of
      hateful behavior, hate speech, or endorsement of ideologies targeting
      individuals or groups based on protected attributes such as race,
      ethnicity, religion, gender identity, and others listed below.
